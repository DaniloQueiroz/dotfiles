**This folder is not empty - we are talking about dot files, do you remember? ;)**

# Syncing files

Use the sync script to sync the dot files to your home and from your home.

## Sync to your home

Use 'sync.sh home'. It will copy all dotfiles to your home - but don't worry, 
your previous dotfiles will be kept with the '.bak' suffix.

## Sync to repo (this folder)

Use 'sync.sh repo'. It will copy all dotfiles to your this folder. And yes,
it will override everything (no .bak files).
